# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I want it to be extremely easy for anyone to ask me questions about anything. This way once a question is asked, anyone can see the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
